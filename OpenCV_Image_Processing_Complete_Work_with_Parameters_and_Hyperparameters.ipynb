    "# OpenCV Image Processing Demonstrations with Detailed Parameter Explanations and Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook where we will learn about various image processing techniques using OpenCV. Each section contains explanations about the techniques, the required code, detailed information about each parameter, hyperparameters that can be used for experimentation, and a Before vs After comparison to help you understand the changes made to the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Covered:\n",
    "1. **Edge Detection** - Finding the edges in an image.\n",
    "2. **Image Sharpening** - Making an image look clearer by highlighting edges.\n",
    "3. **Blur Image** - Softening an image to reduce noise or detail.\n",
    "4. **Image Resize** - Making an image bigger or smaller.\n",
    "5. **Image Rotation** - Changing the orientation of an image.\n",
    "6. **Image Augmentation** - Modifying an image by flipping it.\n",
    "7. **Image Cropping** - Cutting out part of an image.\n",
    "8. **Convert Image to Black and White and Negative** - Changing color representation.\n",
    "9. **Face Detection** - Finding faces in an image.\n",
    "10. **Identifying Facial Features** - Identifying eyes in a face.\n",

    "Let's get started!\n"

    "## 1. Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge detection is used to find the boundaries within images by detecting rapid changes in pixel intensity. We use the **Canny Edge Detection** method, which requires two threshold values to determine the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**: `cv2.Canny(image, threshold1, threshold2)`\n",
    "  - **`threshold1`**: The lower threshold for the intensity gradient. Recommended values are between `50-150`.\n",
    "  - **`threshold2`**: The upper threshold for the intensity gradient. This value should be roughly double `threshold1`.\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameters to Experiment With**:\n",
    "    - `threshold1 = 50`, `threshold2 = 100`: Lower threshold values to include more edges.\n",
    "    - `threshold1 = 100`, `threshold2 = 200`: Balanced approach for sharper edges.\n",
    "    - `threshold1 = 150`, `threshold2 = 300`: Higher thresholds to capture only the most prominent edges.\n",
    "  - **Why These Values**: Experimenting with threshold values helps to understand the sensitivity of edge detection. Lower values detect more edges but may also increase noise.\n"
